# go-mux

This is just a 'Go' learning experiment.

Based on https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/building-and-testing-a-rest-api-in-go-with-gorilla-mux-and-postgresql

### TODO - GOLANG

1. Understand where the go binaries are stored when running get-go. i.e Understand the default recommended package structure.
2. Look into linting. Learn good practices and different options.
3. go.mod? mod stands for module.
